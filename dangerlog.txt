1. Our group has worked on two different versions, one with pure c++ socket, one with boost, and put a lot of time in debugging on two versions, if we plan a better version control,
we can save a lot of time
2. In Previous version, the design and naming of the functions don't follow single responbility principle, a lot of repeated code
3. For pure socket version, we don't use while loop to recv() bytes at first, which can cause error
4. we don't care about the exception in the first version, which can make the server fail
5. At first, the proxy.log directory is not correct
